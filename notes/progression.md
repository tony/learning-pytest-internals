# Chapter 1: Intermediate Fixture Mechanics

## Scope

This chapter reinforces core pytest fixture concepts and pushes into advanced use of scopes, autouse fixtures, and parameterization. It covers how fixture _scope_ (function, class, module, package, session) affects test execution, how to use **autouse** fixtures to automate setup, and in-depth strategies for fixture and test parameterization. By solidifying these mechanics, developers ensure their tests are efficient and maintainable. This foundation is crucial before diving into internals or plugins.

## Key Topics

- **Fixture Scopes and Lifecycle** – Review function vs. broader scopes and when to use each. Illustrate how a module or session scope fixture is created only once per module/session (saving setup cost) vs. function scope created per test ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=Fixtures%20requiring%20network%20access%20depend,package)). Emphasize that broader scopes reuse fixture instances, improving speed for expensive setups (e.g. database connections), but might hold resources in memory longer.
- **Autouse Fixtures** – Deep dive into `autouse=True`. Show how autouse fixtures are automatically applied to tests without explicit reference ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=In%20this%20example%2C%20the%20,just%20that%20it%20isn%E2%80%99t%20necessary)). Cover typical use cases (global test setup/teardown, enabling a feature flag in all tests) and cautions (they run for _every_ test in their scope, so keep them lightweight). Note that autouse fixtures still obey scope rules (e.g. a session-scoped autouse fixture runs once for the session) ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L1222%203)) ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=Autouse%20fixtures%20are%20executed%20first,within%20their%20scope%C2%B6)).
- **Parameterization In-Depth** – Explore advanced parameterization of tests and fixtures. Cover using `@pytest.mark.parametrize` on tests versus the `params=` argument in fixtures. Show how a fixture can yield multiple values by specifying `params` and accessing `request.param` inside ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=%40pytest.fixture%28params%3D%5B0%2C%201%5D%2C%20ids%3D%5B,param)). Discuss using `ids` for readability, and combining multiple parameterized fixtures to produce Cartesian combinations. Highlight that pytest will execute all combinations and how to manage the explosion of test cases.
- **(Optional) Yield Fixtures and Teardown** – Although not explicitly requested, mention yield-based fixtures for completeness. Show how using `yield` in a fixture provides a built-in teardown after the yield, as an alternative to `request.addfinalizer`. This reinforces understanding of fixture lifecycle (setup, test, teardown).

## Why Important

Understanding these mechanics makes test suites more **efficient and reliable**. Choosing the proper fixture scope prevents redundant expensive operations – for example, using a module or session scope can cut test runtime by reusing heavy resources ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=Fixtures%20requiring%20network%20access%20depend,package)). Conversely, knowing to keep scope small (function) when tests shouldn’t share state avoids unintended interactions and memory bloat. Autouse fixtures can reduce boilerplate (no need to request common fixtures everywhere) ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=In%20this%20example%2C%20the%20,just%20that%20it%20isn%E2%80%99t%20necessary)), but must be used judiciously to avoid hidden couplings between tests. Mastering parameterization leads to more comprehensive testing (covering many input variations easily) without manual test case writing. It also prevents mistakes like re-initializing fixtures multiple times – pytest’s fixture caching will reuse results within a test for multiple requests ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=Fixtures%20can%20also%20be%20requested,being%20executed%20more%20than%20once)), so developers can confidently request the same fixture in nested fixtures or test code without performance cost. Overall, this chapter’s skills help create tests that are faster, use memory wisely, and adapt to many scenarios.

## Exercises & Projects

- **Scope Tuning**: Take an existing slow test suite and identify one expensive setup (e.g. starting a database or server). Refactor it into a fixture and try different scopes. For instance, make it session-scoped and observe the speedup (the fixture should run only once per session) and memory impact (the object stays alive until session end). Document the before/after performance.
- **Autouse Audit**: Implement an autouse fixture in a sample project (e.g. an autouse fixture that logs each test’s start time). Ensure it runs for all tests without being explicitly included. Then try limiting its scope (define it in a module or class) to see how it only applies to tests in that context. This exercise confirms your understanding of how autouse fixtures propagate.
- **Parameterized Fixture Challenge**: Write a fixture with `params=` that provides several variations of test data (for example, a fixture that yields different user roles or configurations). Write one test function that uses this fixture. Observe that the test is run multiple times (once per param value) and that inside the fixture you can access the current parameter via `request.param` ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=%40pytest.fixture%28params%3D%5B0%2C%201%5D%2C%20ids%3D%5B,param)). Extend this by adding an `ids` list to the fixture for clearer test IDs, and verify the test names show these IDs.
- **Fixture Teardown Test** (if yield fixtures were covered): Create a fixture that uses `yield` to set up an external resource (like writing to a file) and then clean it up after the yield. For example, yield a temporary directory path, then after the yield remove the directory. Write a test that uses this fixture, ensure the resource is available during the test and gone after. This exercise reinforces fixture finalization order.

# Chapter 2: Internals of Fixtures

## Scope

This chapter peels back the curtain on how pytest implements fixtures under the hood. It covers the internal classes and mechanisms like `FixtureManager` and `FixtureRequest`, how pytest resolves fixture dependencies and manages their lifecycle (creation, caching, teardown), and how fixture values are stored. Understanding these internals is key to diagnosing complex fixture issues and for leveraging hooks or plugins that interface with the fixture system. Essentially, this chapter explains _how_ pytest’s fixture “magic” works behind the scenes.

## Key Topics

- **FixtureManager and Fixture Definitions** – Introduce the `FixtureManager` class, which pytest uses to collect and organize all fixture functions at startup. Explain that when the test session begins, pytest creates a `FixtureManager` (`session._fixturemanager = FixtureManager(session)`) to manage fixture info ([Where does pytest maintain all the fixtures currently in scope? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76884873/where-does-pytest-maintain-all-the-fixtures-currently-in-scope#:~:text=In%20a%20nutshell%20there%20is,for%20a%20given%20test%20session)) ([Where does pytest maintain all the fixtures currently in scope? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76884873/where-does-pytest-maintain-all-the-fixtures-currently-in-scope#:~:text=class%20FixtureManager%3A%20,a%20lookup%20of%20their%20FuncFixtureInfo)). Internally, it stores fixture definitions in a dictionary mapping each fixture name to one or more `FixtureDef` objects ([Where does pytest maintain all the fixtures currently in scope? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76884873/where-does-pytest-maintain-all-the-fixtures-currently-in-scope#:~:text=def%20__init__%28self%2C%20session%3A%20%22Session%22%29%20,explain)). (The list can contain multiple definitions if the same fixture name is defined in different modules or plugins, with the nearest scope overriding others.) Emphasize that this internal dict is how pytest knows which fixture function to call when a test asks for “fixture X.”
- **FixtureRequest and `request` Context** – Discuss the role of the `FixtureRequest` class. Every time a test or fixture asks for another fixture, a FixtureRequest is involved. The special built-in `request` fixture that can be used as a parameter in user-defined fixtures is actually a `FixtureRequest` instance injected by pytest ([python - Where is the request argument coming from in pytest fixtures? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77540116/where-is-the-request-argument-coming-from-in-pytest-fixtures#:~:text=The%20request%20fixture%20gets%20you,do%20something%20dynamic%20with%20pytest)). This object provides context: it knows which test is running, which fixture is being set up, and carries metadata like `request.param` for parameterized fixtures. Key methods of `FixtureRequest` (or its subclass `_pytest.fixtures.SubRequest`) include `getfixturevalue(name)` to fetch other fixtures dynamically and `addfinalizer(func)` to schedule teardown code ([\_pytest.fixtures module — pytest API documentation](https://happytest-apidoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_pytest.fixtures/#:~:text=%60getfixturevalue%60%28argname%29)) ([\_pytest.fixtures module — pytest API documentation](https://happytest-apidoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_pytest.fixtures/#:~:text=%60addfinalizer%60%28finalizer%29)). Understanding `FixtureRequest` helps in advanced fixtures (for example, deciding at runtime to use one fixture or another based on test context).
- **Dependency Resolution (Fixture Graph)** – Describe how pytest determines the order to instantiate fixtures. Pytest builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of fixtures based on who depends on whom, then **linearizes** it for execution ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=pytest%20does%20its%20best%20to,test%20as%20having%20an%20error)). All fixtures required for a test are resolved before the test function is called. Note that autouse fixtures are included in this graph automatically (and they can pull in other fixtures as dependencies). Pytest ensures that each fixture is created at most once per test (per scope) – if two fixtures depend on the same third fixture, that third fixture is only set up once and its value is shared ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=Fixtures%20can%20also%20be%20requested,being%20executed%20more%20than%20once)). Mention that the fixture DAG must not contain cycles, and pytest will raise errors if there are impossible dependencies or scope mismatches (e.g. a module-scoped fixture depending on a function-scoped one).
- **Fixture Lifecycle and Caching** – Dive into what happens during setup and teardown. When pytest goes to execute a test, it sees the required fixtures and checks if they’ve been set up. If not, it calls the fixture function and stores the result. Internally, each `FixtureDef` holds a `cached_result` after execution ([Where does pytest maintain all the fixtures currently in scope? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76884873/where-does-pytest-maintain-all-the-fixtures-currently-in-scope#:~:text=,FixtureValue%5D%5D%20%3D%20None)). This is why requesting the same fixture twice in one test uses the cached value and doesn’t rerun the setup ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=Fixtures%20can%20also%20be%20requested,being%20executed%20more%20than%20once)). Explain how teardown works for different scopes: function-scoped fixtures are torn down right after the test, while broader scopes wait until the end of that scope (e.g., session fixtures teardown at session end). If using `yield` fixtures, pytest handles the code after the `yield` as teardown. If using `addfinalizer`, those finalizers are called appropriately. Understanding this helps ensure resources are released and memory is not leaked across tests.
- **Error Handling in Fixtures** – Briefly cover how fixture-related errors are handled. For example, if a fixture fails to execute (raises an exception), pytest will abort any other fixtures for that test and mark the test as error ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=def%20test_order,1%2C%202%2C%203)). Also mention `FixtureLookupError` (raised when a fixture is requested but not found or incompatible), so the reader knows such errors come from the FixtureManager’s lookup process.

## Why Important

Delving into fixture internals empowers developers to **debug and optimize** complex test suites. When a fixture isn’t behaving as expected (e.g. running multiple times or not at all), knowing about the `FixtureManager` and how fixtures are registered can help pinpoint the issue – perhaps a fixture name collision or scope misunderstanding. Understanding the `FixtureRequest` object lets you do more with fixtures, like retrieving other fixtures on the fly or applying markers dynamically within fixture code (advanced tricks that rely on the request context). The knowledge of dependency resolution means you can reason about the order fixtures execute, which is crucial for avoiding deadlocks (e.g., two fixtures waiting on each other) and for designing fixtures that safely depend on one another. Fixture caching and lifecycle details inform decisions about where to do expensive setup: since pytest caches one instance per test, expensive setups should be in fixtures rather than repeated in tests, and possibly given a broader scope if reuse is safe. This awareness also helps prevent memory leaks – if a fixture allocates large objects, one must remember that a session-scoped fixture will hold them for the entire session. By analyzing the fixture DAG, you can ensure there are no unnecessary dependencies that could slow down or complicate the test run (pytest’s linearization tries to run fixtures in an order, but a poorly thought-out chain can make debugging harder). In short, fixture internals knowledge turns “magic” into logic, making you better at both using fixtures and extending them in advanced ways.

## Exercises & Projects

- **Inspect the Fixture Graph**: Using a sample project with several interdependent fixtures, activate pytest’s setup plan output. Run `pytest --setup-only -q` on a test module and inspect the output ordering of fixtures (pytest will list fixtures setup/teardown in a tree) ([Exploring Pytest Fixtures: Notes and Examples - vladsiv](https://www.vladsiv.com/pytest-fixtures-notes-examples/#:~:text=This%20will%20give%20us%20an,the%20previous%20example%2C%20we%20get)). Draw the dependency graph based on this output. Then alter one fixture’s dependency (e.g., have one fixture no longer depend on another) and see how the order output changes. This will solidify your understanding of fixture resolution order.
- **Experiment with `request.getfixturevalue`**: Write two fixtures, where one needs to choose at runtime which of two other fixtures to use. For example, fixture `data(request)` that checks `request.param` or an environment variable and then calls `request.getfixturevalue("fast_data" if fast else "slow_data")` to get the appropriate fixture value. Use `@pytest.fixture(params=[True, False])` on `data` to simulate both branches ([\_pytest.fixtures module — pytest API documentation](https://happytest-apidoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_pytest.fixtures/#:~:text=%60getfixturevalue%60%28argname%29)). Write tests to ensure that when the param is True, the fast variant fixture ran, and when False, the slow one ran. This exercise uses the `FixtureRequest` API to dynamically control fixture resolution.
- **Cache Validation**: Create a scenario to prove that fixture results are cached per test. For instance, make a fixture `counter` that returns an incrementing number (increment a module-level variable or print a message). Have two other fixtures `uses_counter1(counter)` and `uses_counter2(counter)` that both depend on `counter`. Have a test use both `uses_counter1` and `uses_counter2`. Verify that the underlying `counter` fixture was executed only once (e.g., the printed message or increment only happened once, even though it was needed by two fixtures) ([pytest fixtures: explicit, modular, scalable — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/explanation/fixtures.html#:~:text=Fixtures%20can%20also%20be%20requested,being%20executed%20more%20than%20once)). Then change the fixture to no longer cache (perhaps by returning a new object each time it’s called without using caching – not typical in pytest, or simulate it), to see the difference if possible. Understanding this behavior will help trust pytest’s caching and avoid writing fixtures that inadvertently circumvent it.
- **Scope Mismatch Experiment**: Intentionally create a scope error to see how pytest reacts. For example, define a session-scoped fixture that depends on a function-scoped fixture. Run a test that uses the session fixture and observe the error message (pytest should raise a FixtureLookupError or ScopeMismatch error explaining you can’t do that). Then fix the issue by adjusting scopes (make the dependency fixture also session scoped, or reduce the parent’s scope) and confirm the tests pass. This will teach you how pytest enforces fixture scope rules internally.

# Chapter 3: Custom Fixture Factories

## Scope

This chapter shifts focus to **flexible fixture design** – creating fixtures that are more like factories or generators of test data. It covers patterns where fixtures yield not just static values, but functions or dynamic values that tests can call to generate multiple instances. We explore how to build **factory fixtures** (fixtures that return helper functions), how to programmatically generate data or even new fixtures at runtime, and how to maximize reuse through fixture composition and parameterization. By the end, readers can craft fixtures that adapt to different needs, reducing duplication and making test code more expressive.

## Key Topics

- **Factory-Style Fixtures (Returning Callables)** – Introduce the concept of a fixture that doesn’t just hand a value to the test, but provides a factory function that the test can invoke to create many values. For example, a `make_customer` fixture that returns a function, which the test can call with different parameters to create multiple `Customer` objects ([Five Advanced Pytest Fixture Patterns • Inspired Python](https://www.inspiredpython.com/article/five-advanced-pytest-fixture-patterns#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20very%20powerful,you%20can%20leave%20them%20out)). Demonstrate with a simple example: a `generate_list` fixture that returns an inner function `_generate_list(*args)` which produces a new list from given args ([Exploring Pytest Fixtures: Notes and Examples - vladsiv](https://www.vladsiv.com/pytest-fixtures-notes-examples/#:~:text=We%20can%20create%20a%20fixture,than%20returning%20the%20data%20directly)). The test can call `generate_list(1,2,3)` and `generate_list('a','b')` to get different lists in one test. Emphasize how this pattern is powerful – instead of hard-coding one result per fixture, the fixture becomes a mini _factory_ that tests can use flexibly. It’s useful when a test needs multiple instances of a resource with slight variations.
- **Dynamic Fixture Generation** – Cover techniques for making fixtures dynamic. This could include using logic inside fixtures to return different data based on test context or config. For instance, a fixture might check an environment variable or command-line option and choose a different data source accordingly (e.g., return a local file path vs. a remote URL). Another angle is using **parametrized fixtures** in combination with factory fixtures: e.g., a fixture param decides which dataset to load, and the fixture returns a factory function to generate records from that dataset. Also mention `pytest.generate_tests` hook or `metafunc.parametrize` for completeness – while primarily used for test parametrization, they can dynamically supply parameters to fixtures as well (advanced use case: generating combinations of fixtures at collection time).
- **Fixture Composition and Reusability** – Explain how to compose fixtures from other fixtures to avoid repetition. This means leveraging one fixture inside another (just by declaring it as an argument) to build layered setups. For example, a `db_connection` fixture might use a base `db_config` fixture for credentials; or a `app_client` fixture might depend on a `app` fixture that launches the app. Composition ensures each piece (config, app launch, client) is reusable in different combinations. Discuss best practices: keep fixtures focused on one responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle for fixtures) so they can mix-and-match. When writing factory fixtures, ensure the inner function can accept parameters to customize what it creates, instead of making many almost-duplicate fixtures. This boosts reusability and reduces maintenance.
- **Optimizing Reusability and Memory** – Address how these patterns impact performance. Factory fixtures that create multiple objects in a test should be efficient – e.g., if you repeatedly call the factory, ensure it isn’t doing heavy setup each time needlessly (perhaps the factory uses a cached expensive resource). If a fixture loads a large dataset and then returns a factory to pick items from it, consider scope carefully: loading once at module or session scope and reusing might be better than loading per test, to avoid memory churn. Conversely, ensure that factories don’t hold on to large objects longer than needed (e.g., if they capture a large closure state, make sure to clean up or document it). This ties back to using scopes appropriately with factory fixtures too (you can have a session-scoped factory fixture that provides a generator for data, for example, serving all tests).

## Why Important

Advanced fixture patterns like fixture factories and dynamic generation allow test suites to be **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** and highly **adaptable**. Instead of writing several similar fixtures or helper functions for every variation, a single well-designed factory fixture can serve many tests. This reduces code duplication and makes tests easier to extend – if a new scenario needs a slight tweak in test data, you can often handle it by calling an existing factory with different arguments, rather than writing new setup code. Dynamic fixture behavior is useful for **configuration-driven testing**: for example, running tests with different backends or conditional setup. By letting fixtures introspect context (perhaps via the request or config), you can toggle their behavior without changing test code – tests just ask for the fixture, and it “does the right thing” based on environment. This leads to more **maintainable** tests: you centralize logic in fixtures instead of scattering conditional code in test bodies. Fixture composition further encourages reusability: common setup steps can be shared across fixtures, meaning if something about that setup changes (say, how a database is initialized), you update one fixture instead of dozens of tests. The net effect is a test suite that’s easier to **scale and modify**. From a performance perspective, these techniques also help optimize resource usage: for example, using one loaded dataset for many related tests (via a session fixture that yields a factory) can drastically cut down memory usage compared to loading the data anew for each test. In summary, mastering fixture factories and dynamic fixtures makes you capable of building a flexible test _framework_ on top of pytest – tailoring it precisely to your project’s needs, which is a mark of pytest expertise.

## Exercises & Projects

- **Build a Data Factory Fixture**: Choose an object that your application uses (e.g., a user profile, an order, a log entry) and write a factory fixture for it. For instance, create `@pytest.fixture def make_user()` that returns a function `create_user(name, role)` which builds a user dict/object. In a test, call `user1 = make_user("Alice", "admin")` and `user2 = make_user("Bob", "guest")` and verify their properties. This exercise helps practice returning callables from fixtures. Evolve the fixture by adding default values (so if no arguments given, it creates a default user) to see how it simplifies test code.
- **Dynamic Behavior Fixture**: Implement a fixture that behaves differently based on an external input. For example, a `data_source` fixture that checks `pytest.config.getoption("--env")` to decide whether to read from a local file or remote API. (You can simulate this by adding a custom CLI option via `pytest_addoption` in conftest, e.g., `--env=prod` vs `--env=test`). Write tests that run with different `--env` settings and confirm the fixture returns the expected source. This uses `request.config` or the `config` object to drive fixture logic, demonstrating dynamic fixture generation based on configuration.
- **Fixture Composition Drill**: Create a small scenario like a web app test. Write one fixture `app` that starts a Flask/Django test server (you can stub this if actual server is too heavy), and another fixture `client(app)` that yields a client connected to that app. Then write a test that uses `client` to make a request. Ensure that `app` setup happens before `client` (which should be natural due to dependency). Now extend it: add a `auth_user` fixture that uses `app` (perhaps to create a user in the app’s database) and have `client` depend on `auth_user` too. This will show multiple-layer fixture composition. Run `--setup-plan` to see the order: app sets up, then auth_user, then client ([Exploring Pytest Fixtures: Notes and Examples - vladsiv](https://www.vladsiv.com/pytest-fixtures-notes-examples/#:~:text=pytest_test,F%20b%20TEARDOWN%20M%20a)). All these fixtures can be reused independently (e.g., some tests might only need `app`, others need `client` with no auth, etc.), illustrating the power of composition.
- **Benchmark Parametrized vs. Factory**: Write two sets of tests for a similar task – one that uses a parameterized fixture and one that uses a factory fixture – to understand when each approach is more convenient. For example, testing a calculator with different inputs: implement one version using `@pytest.mark.parametrize` on the test with a list of inputs, and another version using a factory fixture that the test calls in a loop for inputs. Compare which is easier to write and maintain. This isn’t about performance in speed, but developer ergonomics: you’ll learn which scenarios favor using fixture params (when each test invocation is independent and can be separate) versus using a factory in one test (when you want one test to cover multiple variations in sequence).

# Chapter 4: Hooks and Plugin Architecture

## Scope

Now we venture beyond fixtures into **pytest’s hook system and plugin architecture**. This chapter covers how pytest is designed to be extended at almost every step of running tests. We will examine important **hooks** – special functions like `pytest_configure`, `pytest_sessionstart`, `pytest_runtest_setup`, etc. – that pytest calls during its execution timeline. Readers will learn how to implement these hooks in their own conftest files or plugins to modify pytest’s behavior (for example, to skip tests, alter outcomes, or initialize resources globally). We’ll also discuss the plugin architecture: how hooks are discovered and executed, plugin loading order, and how multiple plugins coexist. Mastering hooks is the gateway to writing powerful pytest plugins (covered in the next chapter).

## Key Topics

- **Pytest Hook Mechanism Overview** – Explain what hooks are in pytest: well-defined events in the testing process where user code can intervene. Hooks are just functions following a naming convention `pytest_<hookname>` that pytest will automatically recognize and call. Note that pytest’s own functionality is built on hooks too – e.g., collecting tests, running tests, reporting results are all done via hook calls to internal plugins ([Writing plugins - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_plugins.html#:~:text=A%20plugin%20contains%20one%20or,63%20of%20the%20following%20plugins)). Introduce the `pluggy` system briefly (pytest’s plugin management library) which manages hook registration and calling. Mention that multiple plugins (including conftest files) can provide the same hook, and all will be invoked by pytest unless the hook specifies otherwise (some hooks only take the first result) ([Writing hook functions - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html#:~:text=Most%20calls%20to%20,of%20the%20called%20hook%20functions)). This ensures pytest is very extensible: you can insert custom logic at many points without modifying pytest’s source.
- **Lifecycle Hooks (configure, session, teardown)** – Focus on the hooks mentioned: `pytest_configure`, `pytest_sessionstart`, `pytest_runtest_setup`, etc., and place them in the context of the test run lifecycle. For example: `pytest_configure(config)` is called after command-line options are parsed, before tests are collected – often used to set up global state or configure the environment. `pytest_sessionstart(session)` is called at the very start of the session (after collection, right before running tests) ([Writing a Pytest plugin](https://blog.pecar.me/pytest-plugin#:~:text=%2B,pytest_collection%28%29%201%3A1)), and its counterpart `pytest_sessionfinish(session, exitstatus)` at the end – good for allocating and freeing expensive resources that last the entire run. `pytest_runtest_setup(item)` runs before each test item’s fixtures are set up and test is executed, allowing per-test checks or modifications (you could skip a test here based on condition, or inject dynamics) ([Writing a Pytest plugin](https://blog.pecar.me/pytest-plugin#:~:text=%7C%20%20%20%2B,pytest_sessionfinish)). Similarly, `pytest_runtest_teardown(item)` runs after the test. Give concrete examples: using `pytest_runtest_setup` to skip tests that don’t meet a criterion (like skip tests not marked with “supported” in a certain configuration), or using `pytest_configure` to register a custom marker or to turn on verbose logging across the suite. By mapping out these hooks in order (perhaps via a simplified timeline), readers see how a test session progresses and where they can plug in ([Writing a Pytest plugin](https://blog.pecar.me/pytest-plugin#:~:text=%2B,pytest_runtest_logstart)).
- **Implementing Hook Functions** – Describe how to write a hook in practice. For instance, in a `conftest.py` (which is a local plugin), you can define `def pytest_runtest_logreport(report): ...` to examine test results, or `def pytest_collection_modifyitems(session, config, items): ...` to reorder or modify the collected tests. Emphasize that the function name and signature must match the pytest specification exactly, or it won’t be called ([Writing hook functions - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html#:~:text=pytest%20calls%20hook%20functions%20from,all%20test%20items%20is%20completed)). Pytest will automatically discover these in conftest or in any installed plugins. Also mention that hook functions should generally avoid raising exceptions (except for special cases like hooks that expect a return) because it can interrupt the test run ([Writing hook functions - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html#:~:text=compatibility%20of%20pytest%20plugins)). If multiple hooks are present, pytest provides certain ordering guarantees but typically runs them all (the order can sometimes be controlled via the `hookimpl` decorator options, but that’s advanced). Introduce the concept of **hook wrappers** (advanced): a hook can be marked with `@pytest.hookimpl(wrapper=True)` to surround the execution of the normal hook (useful for timing or logging around all hook calls) ([Writing hook functions - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html#:~:text=pytest%20plugins%20can%20implement%20hook,as%20to%20the%20regular%20hooks)) ([Writing hook functions - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html#:~:text=import%20pytest)), though this might be detailed for this outline. The key is that implementing hooks is straightforward – just define a function – but one must know the hook name and expected arguments from the docs.
- **Conftest vs. External Plugins** – Clarify that conftest.py files are a convenient way to implement hooks (and fixtures) for a specific test suite (they are automatically loaded by pytest in that directory scope). In contrast, external (or third-party) plugins are installed packages that also can implement hooks. The difference is mostly in distribution: conftest is local, a plugin package is reusable. The hook mechanisms are identical for both. This sets the stage for the next chapter on writing and distributing plugins. It’s useful to mention that pytest comes with many **builtin plugins** (for capture, xfail, etc.) which are implemented using the same hooks – demonstrating the power of the design.

## Why Important

Hooks are the **heart of plugin development** in pytest. For experienced developers, knowing hooks means you are not limited to just what pytest offers out of the box – you can change its behavior to fit your needs. For example, if you need to generate tests dynamically, you’d use `pytest_collection_modifyitems`; if you need a global setup/teardown beyond fixtures (say, start a docker container once for all tests and tear it down at the very end), `pytest_sessionstart` and `pytest_sessionfinish` are your friends. In day-to-day use, understanding hooks also helps to troubleshoot and configure plugins you use. When a plugin (like pytest-cov or pytest-django) does something at a weird time, knowing the hook timeline can explain it (e.g., pytest-django might use `pytest_configure` to set up the Django environment early). Moreover, sometimes fixtures alone aren’t enough – for instance, skipping or modifying tests based on dynamic conditions may require a hook rather than a fixture. Advanced testing scenarios (like altering test collection, or implementing custom test outcome actions) are only possible with hooks. So, familiarity with hooks and the plugin architecture makes you capable of **extending pytest in new directions**. It also ensures **plugin longevity**: by using official hooks, your extensions are less likely to break with new pytest versions, because hooks are a stable extension interface (pytest adds new hook arguments in a backward-compatible way, ignoring extra arguments if your function doesn’t accept them ([Writing hook functions - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html#:~:text=Here%2C%20,lived%20compatibility%20of%20pytest%20plugins))). In summary, hooks give you a deeper control of the test execution process – a critical skill for a pytest power user and plugin author.

## Exercises & Projects

- **Trace the Hook Timeline**: Write a conftest.py that implements a few simple hooks that print messages (or log) when they are called. For example, `pytest_configure`, `pytest_sessionstart`, `pytest_runtest_setup`, and `pytest_runtest_teardown`. In each, print the hook name and maybe some contextual info (like the test item in runtest_setup). Run a small test file and observe the order of prints. This will concretely show the call order of these events. Try to add `pytest_collection_finish` to see when collection is done, and `pytest_sessionfinish` to see the very end. This exercise reinforces the sequence of phases in a pytest run.
- **Custom Skipper Hook**: Use the `pytest_runtest_setup(item)` hook to implement a custom skip logic. For instance, skip any test function that has a name containing “slow” if a certain condition is met (like an env var or config flag is not set). In the hook, you can do: `if "slow" in item.name: pytest.skip("skipped slow test")`. Verify that when you run tests normally, those tests get skipped with your message. Then disable the skipping condition (set the env var or flag) and confirm the tests run. This mimics how one might implement conditional skipping without using marks, purely via hooks.
- **Global Resource Setup**: Use `pytest_configure` or `pytest_sessionstart` to allocate a resource that all tests use, without explicitly requesting it as a fixture. For example, create a temporary directory or start a background thread in `pytest_sessionstart`, and then use `pytest_sessionfinish` to clean it up. Inside tests, even though they don’t see a fixture, they could rely on that global state (perhaps the dir path is available via an environment variable set in configure). While generally fixtures are better for this, this exercise shows how plugins can set up global state. Be sure to document or print when the setup/teardown happens to see that it indeed wraps the entire session.
- **Explore an Existing Plugin**: Pick a simple third-party pytest plugin (or a built-in one via pytest documentation) and identify at least one hook it uses. For instance, `pytest-cov` (coverage plugin) likely uses hooks like `pytest_runtest_teardown` to collect coverage data after each test. Read its source (or docs) to see those hook implementations. Write a short summary of which hooks the plugin uses and why. This will connect the concept of hooks to real-world usage and prepare you for writing your own plugin.

# Chapter 5: Writing Advanced Plugins

## Scope

Having learned about hooks, we now focus on **developing full-fledged pytest plugins** and ensuring they are robust, efficient, and maintainable. This chapter covers how to set up a new plugin (structuring it as a Python module or package), how to register it so pytest can discover it, and best practices for plugin development. We’ll discuss providing fixtures and commands via plugins, handling configuration options, and considerations like avoiding conflicts and maintaining compatibility with pytest updates (plugin longevity). Additionally, we touch on distributing plugins (via PyPI, using entry points) and guiding principles to make plugins reliable in the long run (tests, docs, following pytest’s compatibility guidelines). By the end, readers can create a plugin that others could install and use in their projects.

## Key Topics

- **Plugin Structure and Registration** – Walk through the creation of a simple plugin package. Typically, you create a standard Python package (or even just a single module). You can distribute it via PyPI so others can `pip install` it. The critical part is **registering the plugin** so pytest auto-loads it. The recommended way is to use the `pytest11` **entry point** in setup configurations, which advertises your plugin to pytest ([Writing a Pytest plugin](https://blog.pecar.me/pytest-plugin#:~:text=,file)). For example, in your `pyproject.toml` or `setup.cfg`, add:
  ```toml
  [project.entry-points.pytest11]
  myplugin = "myplugin.module"
  ```
  This means when pytest runs, it will import `myplugin.module` as a plugin. Explain that when installed, pytest lists the plugin in the startup header (e.g., `plugins: myplugin-1.0.0`) ([Writing a Pytest plugin](https://blog.pecar.me/pytest-plugin#:~:text=%E2%9D%AF%20pytest%20%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%3D%20test%20session,2023.10.6%20collected%203%20items)). Alternatively, mention that local plugins (conftest) don’t need this, and you can also explicitly load plugins via `-p` or the `pytest_plugins` variable, but entry points are the smoothest for distribution.
- **Implementing Plugin Features** – Describe common things plugins do and how to do them:
  - _Provide Fixtures_: A plugin can define fixtures just like conftest. If the plugin module has `@pytest.fixture` functions, they become available to any test suite using the plugin. For instance, a plugin could provide a fixture `@pytest.fixture def api_client(): ...` that tests can use after installing the plugin. No special registration beyond just declaring the fixture is needed – pytest will find it via the plugin.
  - _Add CLI Options and Ini Settings_: Use the `pytest_addoption(parser)` hook to introduce new command-line flags or config file settings. This is important for plugins that need configuration (e.g., a plugin that needs an API key might add `--api-key` option). Show a brief example:
    ```python
    def pytest_addoption(parser):
        parser.addoption("--api-key", action="store", help="API key for the service")
    ```
    and how to retrieve it in fixtures or hooks via `config.getoption("api_key")`.
  - _Use Hooks for Functionality_: Recap that any hook can be implemented in the plugin to modify behavior. For example, a plugin might implement `pytest_runtest_logreport` to output a custom log for failed tests, or `pytest_terminal_summary` to add extra summary info at the end of a run. Emphasize that advanced plugins often utilize multiple hooks – e.g., one to collect data during tests, another to report at the end.
  - _Isolation and Conflicts_: Advise that plugin code should be careful to not interfere with other plugins or core unless intentional. For example, if two plugins both implement the same hook, they should ideally not step on each other’s toes (pytest will call both, but if they modify shared data, it could conflict). Techniques like using unique marker names or checking for other plugin presence via `config.pluginmanager` can help manage this.
- **Testing and Maintaining Plugins** – Encourage writing tests for your plugin (possibly using `pytester` or by running pytest in a subprocess within tests to see plugin effects). This ensures the plugin works as expected and continues to work with new pytest releases. Mention that pytest’s own test suite or using continuous integration with multiple pytest versions is a good idea for plugin maintenance. Also highlight pytest’s **backwards compatibility policy** for hooks: the core devs strive not to break existing hooks or change their call signature incompatibly (new parameters are added with defaults) ([Writing hook functions - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html#:~:text=Here%2C%20,lived%20compatibility%20of%20pytest%20plugins)). This means if you stick to documented hooks and APIs, your plugin should work across pytest upgrades for a long time. However, if you rely on internal details (undocumented features or `_pytest` internals), those can change without notice, so avoid that if possible. A robust plugin stays within the public API. If something isn’t available as a hook and you feel tempted to monkey-patch pytest, that’s a sign to discuss a new hook with the core team instead (for longevity).
- **Distribution and Community** – Briefly cover how to release a plugin to PyPI (so others can install it). Use standard packaging tools (set version, write a README with usage instructions, etc.). Once published, you can advertise it by adding it to the PyPI classifiers for pytest plugins. Note that there is a “pytest-dev” organization for many plugins; contributing a plugin there can help with visibility and maintenance. Encourage documenting the plugin well, including the hooks/fixtures it provides and examples. Also mention that maintaining a plugin means watching pytest’s release notes – e.g., if a new pytest version deprecates a hook you use, update your plugin accordingly. This proactive approach ensures **plugin longevity** – some widely used plugins have worked for many years across numerous pytest versions because they followed these practices.

## Why Important

Writing your own plugins elevates you from pytest power user to **pytest extender**. This is crucial when you find your testing needs aren’t fully met by existing tools – you can create plugins to integrate pytest with other systems (like frameworks, databases, or custom reporting tools). Advanced plugins can save enormous time for teams by encapsulating complex logic (for example, environment setup or result aggregation) into reusable components. By mastering plugin development, you also contribute back to the community: many open-source plugins start as in-house tools that get shared. From a career standpoint, being able to create and maintain pytest plugins is a notable skill for any test engineer or developer – it shows the ability to tailor and improve the tooling. Additionally, focusing on robustness (efficient fixtures, careful hook usage) and longevity (staying compatible with new pytest versions) ensures that the plugins you write remain **reliable** assets rather than breaking with updates. Pytest’s design encourages this – the use of entry points and hook validation helps maintain compatibility ([Writing hook functions - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html#:~:text=Here%2C%20,lived%20compatibility%20of%20pytest%20plugins)). When you write plugins with these principles, they can last for years with minimal changes, even as pytest evolves. Finally, distributing a plugin and seeing others use it can be rewarding and provides feedback to improve it further. In summary, advanced plugin development is the capstone of pytest expertise – it allows you to bend pytest to your will, and if done right, your plugin can become an integral part of many projects’ testing strategies.

## Exercises & Projects

- **Hello World Plugin**: Create a minimal plugin package from scratch. Make a directory `hello_pytest`, add a `pyproject.toml` with the pytest11 entry point, and a module `hello.py` with a simple hook implementation (for example, `pytest_terminal_summary` that prints “Hello from plugin” at the end of tests). Install it in a virtual environment (e.g. `pip install -e .` for editable). Run pytest and see if your message appears, confirming the plugin loaded. This exercise walks through the end-to-end of writing and using a plugin.
- **Fixture Plugin**: Develop a plugin that provides a fixture and use it in a sample test project. For instance, a plugin `pytest-cloud` that provides a `@pytest.fixture def cloud_client()` which maybe prints “Connected to cloud” and yields a dummy client object. Write tests in a separate project (or tests within the plugin itself using `pytester`) that use `cloud_client`. Run them to ensure the fixture is indeed available when the plugin is installed (you shouldn’t need any import in the test, it should just work by name). This confirms you know how to contribute fixtures via a plugin.
- **Plugin Configuration**: Extend the above plugin (or create a new one) to accept a command-line option. For example, add `--cloud-url` option in `pytest_addoption`. Make the `cloud_client` fixture read that option via `config.getoption("cloud_url")` and print it or use it. Write tests to simulate different CLI options (you can use `pytester.runpytest` with `-q` and the option in a test, or just manual testing). Ensure that default values are handled when the option isn’t given. This exercise covers adding user configurability to plugins.
- **Compatibility Check**: Intentionally use an internal detail of pytest in a plugin and then update pytest to a newer version to see what happens. For example, directly call an internal function from `_pytest` (not recommended in real life). When you update, see if a warning or error occurs. Then refactor the plugin to use a public hook or API to achieve the same result. This teaches the importance of sticking to the public API. (If it’s hard to simulate, you can also read a real plugin’s history – find a plugin that had to change due to a pytest update – and note what internal API change caused it. Many changelogs or commit messages in plugin repos explain “changed X because pytest Y deprecated it”).
- **Publishing (Optional)**: If you’re feeling confident, actually publish a simple plugin to PyPI. This involves packaging (ensure your pyproject has name, version, entry point) and using `twine` to upload. While not necessary for learning, going through the motions of publication will expose you to considerations like naming (your plugin name should be unique on PyPI and include “pytest-” prefix ideally), writing a good README (so users know how to use it), and semantic versioning for future releases. Even if you don’t publish, writing a README as if you were releasing it is a good exercise – it forces you to clarify the plugin’s purpose and usage.

# Chapter 6: Contributing to Pytest Core

## Scope

In the final chapter, we turn to **contributing back to pytest itself**. This is about going from plugin development to improving the pytest core framework. We cover how to navigate the pytest codebase and understand its architecture, so you can confidently make changes or add features. Key aspects include setting up a dev environment for pytest, running its extensive test suite, following coding style and guidelines, and understanding the contribution workflow (issues, pull requests, code review). We’ll also discuss how new features in pytest are typically implemented (often via new hooks or changes in existing plugins) and how to ensure backward compatibility when contributing. By learning this, even if you don’t immediately contribute, you gain insight into why pytest works the way it does and how to extend it in a sustainable manner.

## Key Topics

- **Pytest Codebase Structure** – Provide an overview of how pytest’s source is organized. For example, the `src/_pytest` directory contains many modules corresponding to different functionalities: `_pytest/fixtures.py` for fixture machinery, `_pytest/config/` for configuration and plugin manager, `_pytest/terminal.py` for terminal reporting, etc. Highlight that a lot of pytest’s own features are implemented as plugins (builtin plugins) – e.g., assertion rewriting, capture, etc., are in modules that register hooks. This modular structure means when contributing, you often modify a specific plugin or add a new one. Explain how the entry point script (`pytest`) initializes a `PytestPluginManager` and loads plugins (including conftest and third-party) ([Writing plugins - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_plugins.html#:~:text=A%20plugin%20contains%20one%20or,63%20of%20the%20following%20plugins)), then orchestrates test collection and execution by calling hooks ([Writing a Pytest plugin](https://blog.pecar.me/pytest-plugin#:~:text=A%20,before%20each%20test%20is%20run)). Knowing where things live (like the collection logic is in `_pytest/main.py` or `_pytest/python.py`) helps you find the right place to make a change.
- **Setting Up a Dev Environment** – Walk through the steps to get started contributing: fork the repository, clone it, install development requirements. Pytest uses `tox` for testing across environments. Show a common scenario: you found a bug or want a new feature in fixtures. You would open the `pytest-dev/pytest` repository, perhaps search for “FixtureManager” or the code related to your issue (as we saw in a Stack Overflow example, searching the repo for a keyword can be illuminating ([Where does pytest maintain all the fixtures currently in scope? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76884873/where-does-pytest-maintain-all-the-fixtures-currently-in-scope#:~:text=In%20a%20nutshell%20there%20is,for%20a%20given%20test%20session))). After making code changes, you run `tox` with appropriate environments to ensure all tests pass. Mention that running `tox -e py39` (for Python 3.9 for example) will run pytest’s own test suite on that Python ([Contributing - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contributing.html#:~:text=3.%20Enable%20and%20install%20pre,and%20code%20checks%20are%20followed)). The test suite is quite large, but if you’re working on a specific part, you can run just those tests (e.g., `pytest -k "fixtures" tests/fixtures` to run fixture-related tests within the pytest project). Also note style checks: pytest follows PEP8 and uses tools like `pre-commit` to enforce formatting ([Contributing - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contributing.html#:~:text=3.%20Enable%20and%20install%20pre,and%20code%20checks%20are%20followed)). As a contributor, you need to ensure your code is formatted and linted properly (the test run will include linting).
- **Contribution Guidelines** – Summarize the important points from pytest’s contributing docs: all changes should have an accompanying change in documentation and tests (if applicable). For a new feature, you’d typically start by discussing it (maybe an issue on GitHub) to get feedback on the approach. If implementing a feature, consider backward compatibility: e.g., if adding a new hook or parameter, ensure old plugins don’t break (usually by making it optional or providing a default). The project may require you to add a Changelog entry file describing your change (pytest uses a towncrier tool, hence the `changelog/` folder entries) ([Contributing - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contributing.html#:~:text=The%20test%20environments%20above%20are,to%20cover%20most%20cases%20locally)). And you may be asked to add yourself to AUTHORS for significant contributions ([Contributing - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contributing.html#:~:text=,the%20issue%20type)). Explain that contributing to core is a collaborative process: core maintainers will review your pull request, suggest changes, and you might iterate before merge. It’s a good practice to start with smaller contributions (like bug fixes or docs) to get familiar.
- **Understanding Core Decisions** – Delve into how features are added to pytest core. Often, if something can be done as a plugin, core devs might lean towards that unless it’s broadly useful. But many features we use (like parametrize, xfail, etc.) are baked in because they need tight integration. If you were to add a new feature, you might do so by introducing a new hook (so that the feature can be utilized or customized by plugins). For example, if you wanted pytest to handle a new file type as tests, you might add a new hook in the collection phase. Emphasize reading existing code for guidance: e.g., if adding a hook, look at how other hooks are defined in `pytest/hooks.py` (or how pluggy is configured). Mention the backward-compatibility policy: if you change a hook signature or behavior, it may need a deprecation period to not break users immediately ([Writing hook functions - pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html#:~:text=Here%2C%20,lived%20compatibility%20of%20pytest%20plugins)). Pytest is very mature, so changes are considered carefully; as a contributor you learn discipline in maintaining stability for a large user base.
- **Getting Help and Involved** – Encourage engaging with the community: the mailing list or GitHub discussions for pytest can be a place to ask questions if you’re unsure about an approach. Also, looking at open issues labeled as “good first issue” or “help wanted” in the pytest repo is a good way to start. There might also be opportunities to contribute to the documentation or write example recipes in the docs (which is highly valued too). Contributing to core not only improves pytest for everyone, but it deepens your expertise – you’ll likely read parts of the code that reveal advanced usage or edge cases you hadn’t considered.

## Why Important

Contributing to pytest core is the pinnacle of understanding – it means you can **navigate and improve one of the most popular testing frameworks**. Even if one’s goal isn’t to become a maintainer, the act of exploring the code and possibly contributing a patch provides unparalleled insight. It forces you to truly grasp how things are implemented (we often learn by reading and modifying code). From a practical standpoint, if your team relies on pytest and you hit a limitation or bug, having the skill to dive in and perhaps patch it can unblock you faster than waiting for others. It also means you can influence the future of the tool – by implementing a feature that many could benefit from, you leave a mark on the ecosystem. Additionally, the discipline of following a large open-source project’s contribution process is valuable experience for writing high-quality code: you learn about testing your changes thoroughly, documenting them, and thinking about users’ existing tests (backward compatibility). This experience can translate to better design decisions in your own projects. Finally, contributing to core can be personally rewarding – becoming a part of the pytest developer community, getting recognition in release notes, etc. It solidifies your status as a pytest expert and gives back to the very tool that supports your testing workflow. In summary, this chapter underlines that with deep knowledge comes the ability to improve the tool itself, closing the loop from user to contributor.

## Exercises & Projects

- **Bug Fix Walkthrough**: Find a real open issue in the pytest repository that looks manageable (for example, something in fixtures or markers). Fork the repo and try to reproduce the bug with a test. Then locate the relevant code by searching the repo. Apply a fix locally and run pytest’s test suite to see if you’ve resolved it (and haven’t broken anything else). Even if you don’t submit the PR, compare your solution with any existing PR or maintainer comments. This exercise simulates the core contribution process end-to-end: understanding the issue, locating code, fixing, and testing.
- **Add a Custom Hook (theoretically)**: Imagine a new hook that could be useful (for instance, `pytest_test_retry` for retrying failed tests, if it didn’t exist). In your fork, define this new hook in the appropriate place (likely in core hooks definition and where it would be called, e.g., around `pytest_runtest_call`). Write a couple of plugin functions using this hook in a dummy plugin to ensure it works. While this might not be merged, it teaches you how to add hooks to pytest. (Be cautious and do this in a throwaway branch; it’s for learning how things connect.)
- **Coverage Dive**: Pytest’s own tests can teach a lot. Pick a component (like fixtures or the assertion rewrite) and find its tests in the pytest codebase (under the `testing/` directory). Read a few tests to see how the behavior is supposed to be. Then find the implementation of that component. For example, read tests for fixture ordering or caching, then open `_pytest/fixtures.py` and confirm how it achieves what the tests expect. Write a short summary or even draw a flowchart of the component. This solidifies your reading of others’ code and connecting specs (tests) to implementation – a key skill in contributing effectively.
- **Follow the Contribution Guide**: As a simpler task, take the official contribution guide ([Contribution getting started — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/4.6.x/contributing.html#:~:text=Contributions%20are%20highly%20welcomed%20and,counts%2C%20so%20do%20not%20hesitate)) ([Contribution getting started — pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/4.6.x/contributing.html#:~:text=Fix%20bugs%20%207)) (or the “CONTRIBUTING.rst” in the repo) and ensure you can run the tests and linters. For example, run `tox -e py,linting` (or the appropriate environment for your setup) to run both tests and linters. Fix any linter errors that your editor might introduce. Submit a trivial PR (maybe updating documentation or a typo fix) to go through the motions of forking, branching, committing, and opening a pull request. This gets you comfortable with the workflow so that when you tackle a more complex change, the mechanics are second nature.
- **Engage with the Community**: As a project, write a short proposal for a hypothetical new pytest feature or plugin, and share it (you don’t actually have to post it, but frame it as if you would on the mailing list or GitHub). For example, propose a plugin that integrates pytest with a certain tool, or a core feature like a new command-line option. In your proposal, identify what hook or core change would be needed and how you might implement it. This exercise forces you to articulate a problem/solution clearly and consider design and compatibility – which is exactly what one needs to do for real contributions. It also encourages you to think from the maintainers’ perspective.
